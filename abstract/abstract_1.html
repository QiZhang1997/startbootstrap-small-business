        <p>Docker containers have been increasingly adopted on various computing platforms
            to provide a lightweight virtualized execution environment. Compared to virtual
            machines, this technology can often reduce the launch time from a few minutes
            to less than 10 seconds, assuming the Docker image has been locally available.
            However, Docker images are highly customizable, and are mostly built at run time
            from a remote base image by running instructions in a script (the Dockerﬁle).
            During the instruction execution, a large number of input ﬁles may have to be
            retrieved via the Internet.The image building may be an iterative process as one
            may need to repeatedly modify the Dockerﬁle until a desired image composition
            is received. In the process, each ﬁle required by an instruction has to be remotely
            retrieved, even if it has been recently downloaded. This can make the process of
            building, and launching a container unexpectedly slow. </p>

        <p>To address the issue,we propose a technique,named Fast Build, that maintains a local
            ﬁle cache to minimize the expensive ﬁle downloading.Bynon-intrusively intercepting
            remote ﬁle requests, and supplying ﬁles locally, FastBuild enables ﬁle caching in
            a manner transparent to image building. To further accelerate the image building,
            FastBuild overlaps operations of instructions’ execution, and writing intermediate
            image layers to the disk. We have implemented FastBuild. Experiments with images
            and Dockerﬁles obtained from Docker Hub show that our system can improve building
            speed by up to 10 times, reduce downloaded data by 72%.</p>
